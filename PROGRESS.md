# Google Drive Image Processor - Progress Summary

## Project Overview
Automated batch processing system for Google Drive media files using AI vision models, specifically designed for permaculture communities. System processes images from Google Drive shared folders, extracts metadata using AI, and provides a web interface for browsing and comparing results.

## Current Status: Full Pipeline & UI Complete ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Foundation Complete ‚úÖ
- [x] **Project Structure**: Complete Python package structure with proper organization
- [x] **Core Data Models**: 
  - `MediaFile` dataclass with Google Drive integration fields
  - `ExtractedMetadata` dataclass with permaculture-focused schema
  - `ProcessingStatus` enum for state management
  - Predefined activity tags and validation constants
- [x] **Configuration Management**: 
  - YAML-based configuration with dataclass validation
  - Environment variable support
  - Local Gemma model + Claude API support
- [x] **Database Implementation**: 
  - SQLite schema with full metadata support
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Migration and connection management

### Phase 2: Google Drive Integration Complete ‚úÖ
- [x] **Google Drive Service**: 
  - OAuth2 authentication with service account
  - Shared drive discovery and file enumeration
  - Metadata extraction from Drive API
  - Thumbnail generation and caching
- [x] **Processing Pipeline**: 
  - Resumable batch processing with state tracking
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - HEIF/HEIC format support with conversion
  - Progress tracking and logging

### Phase 3: AI Vision Integration Complete ‚úÖ
- [x] **Local Gemma Integration**: 
  - LM Studio API client for local processing
  - Structured JSON prompt engineering
  - Fallback handling for model failures
- [x] **Claude 3.5 Haiku Integration**: 
  - Anthropic API client with 2-pass analysis system
  - Pass 1: Visual analysis and content description
  - Pass 2: Critical scoring with strict criteria
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Phase 4: Web Application Complete ‚úÖ
- [x] **Backend API**: 
  - Express.js server with RESTful endpoints
  - Database switching capability for A/B testing
  - Image serving with authentication
  - Search and filtering capabilities
- [x] **Frontend Application**: 
  - React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
  - Database picker for comparing AI model results
  - Advanced search and filtering interface
  - Responsive grid layout with pagination (50 images/page)
  - Compact image cards (150px wide) with full image coverage
  - Large image detail modal with compact metadata sidebar

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **2-Pass AI Analysis System**: Implemented dual-phase processing for better accuracy
2. **Multi-Database Comparison**: Frontend can switch between different .db files to compare AI model results
3. **Optimized UI**: Compact card design showing essential metadata (scores, filename, path) for efficient browsing
4. **Full Pipeline**: Complete end-to-end processing from Google Drive discovery to web visualization
5. **HEIF/HEIC Support**: Automatic conversion for Apple device photos
6. **Authenticated Downloads**: Secure file access through Google Drive API

### Architecture Highlights
- **Pipeline Design**: Discovery ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Web Access
- **Resumable Processing**: State tracking with database persistence  
- **Multi-Model Support**: Local Gemma + Cloud Claude for comparison testing
- **Database Switching**: Runtime database selection for A/B testing
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing large image collections

### Current Databases
- `image_metadata.db`: Original local Gemma processing results
- `claude_2pass.db`: Claude 3.5 Haiku 2-pass analysis results  
- `cloudtest.db`: Additional test database

### Recent UI Improvements (Latest Session)
- [x] **Compact Image Cards**: 150px wide thumbnails with full image coverage
- [x] **Essential Metadata Only**: Shows only scores (VQ, SM, MK), filename, and filepath
- [x] **Pagination**: 50 images per page with intuitive navigation
- [x] **Large Detail Modal**: Redesigned with large image + compact sidebar layout
- [x] **Clean Code**: Removed all leftover old layout code from components

## Testing Results
- Successfully processed 150+ images with both Gemma and Claude models
- Claude 3.5 Haiku showing superior results in accuracy and consistency
- UI efficiently displays large image collections with fast navigation
- Database switching works seamlessly for model comparison

## Next Phase: Enhanced Image Management ‚è≥

### Planned Improvements (In Order)
1. **Image Rotation Feature** üîÑ
   - UI controls for rotating images (90¬∞ increments)
   - Backend storage of rotation state per image
   - Display rotated images correctly in grid and detail views
   - Consider: Database field vs image transformation approach

2. **Aspect Ratio Preservation** üìê
   - Fix square thumbnail issue - images appear to be cropped
   - Ensure full image content is visible without distortion
   - Maintain responsive design while showing true image proportions

3. **Image Dimensions & Search** üìè
   - Add width/height fields to database schema
   - Extract dimensions during processing pipeline
   - Make dimensions searchable in UI filters
   - Display dimensions in image metadata

### Implementation Plan
- Each feature will be implemented and committed separately
- Update PROGRESS.md after each completion
- Test thoroughly before moving to next feature
