# Lost Valley Image Manager - Progress Summary

## Project Overview
Automated batch processing system for Google Drive media files using AI vision models, specifically designed for permaculture communities. System processes images from Google Drive shared folders, extracts metadata using AI, and provides a web interface for browsing and comparing results.

## Current Status: Production-Ready with Pinterest-Style Gallery ✅

  - `ProcessingStatus` enum for state management
  - Predefined activity tags and validation constants
- [x] **Configuration Management**: 
  - YAML-based configuration with dataclass validation
  - Environment variable support
  - Local Gemma model + Claude API support
- [x] **Database Implementation**: 
  - SQLite schema with full metadata support
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Migration and connection management

### Phase 2: Google Drive Integration Complete ✅

  - OAuth2 authentication with service account
  - Shared drive discovery and file enumeration
  - Metadata extraction from Drive API
  - Thumbnail generation and caching
- [x] **Processing Pipeline**: 
  - Resumable batch processing with state tracking
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - HEIF/HEIC format support with conversion
  - Progress tracking and logging

### Phase 3: AI Vision Integration Complete ✅
- [x] **Local Gemma Integration**: 
  - LM Studio API client for local processing
  - Structured JSON prompt engineering
  - Fallback handling for model failures
- [x] **Claude 3.5 Haiku Integration**: 
  - Anthropic API client with 2-pass analysis system
  - Pass 1: Visual analysis and content description
  - Pass 2: Critical scoring with strict criteria
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Phase 4: Web Application Complete ✅
- [x] **Backend API**: 
  - Express.js server with RESTful endpoints
  - Database switching capability for A/B testing
  - Image serving with authentication
  - Search and filtering capabilities
- [x] **Frontend Application**: 
  - React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
  - Database picker for comparing AI model results
  - Advanced search and filtering interface
  - Responsive grid layout with pagination (50 images/page)
  - Compact image cards (150px wide) with full image coverage
  - Large image detail modal with compact metadata sidebar

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **2-Pass AI Analysis System**: Implemented dual-phase processing for better accuracy
2. **Multi-Database Comparison**: Frontend can switch between different .db files to compare AI model results
3. **Optimized UI**: Compact card design showing essential metadata (scores, filename, path) for efficient browsing
4. **Full Pipeline**: Complete end-to-end processing from Google Drive discovery to web visualization
5. **HEIF/HEIC Support**: Automatic conversion for Apple device photos
6. **Authenticated Downloads**: Secure file access through Google Drive API

### Architecture Highlights
- **Pipeline Design**: Discovery → Processing → Storage → Web Access
- **Resumable Processing**: State tracking with database persistence  
- **Multi-Model Support**: Local Gemma + Cloud Claude for comparison testing
- **Database Switching**: Runtime database selection for A/B testing
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing large image collections

### Current Databases (Organized in `/databases/` folder)
- `claude_2pass.db`: Primary Claude 3.5 Haiku 2-pass analysis results
- `cloudtest.db`: Additional test database  
- `image_metadata.db`: Original local Gemma processing results
- `data_image_metadata.db`: Development database backup

### Recent Major Improvements
- [x] **Pinterest-Style Masonry Gallery**: CSS-based multi-column layout with golden ratio sizing
- [x] **Golden Ratio Sizing**: Images sized based on AI scores (φ = 1.618) - higher quality = larger size
- [x] **Score-Based Dynamic Sizing**: 200px base, 324px (φ), 524px (φ²) tiers + 10% random variation
- [x] **Loading Skeletons**: Prevent jarring layout jumps during image load
- [x] **Hover-Only Score Display**: Clean UI with compact scores shown only on hover
- [x] **Project Organization**: Databases moved to `/databases/`, test files archived in `/archive/`
- [x] **Port Standardization**: Frontend on 3005, Backend on 5005 with proper CORS configuration

### Current Issues to Resolve
- [x] **Complete Application Flow**: RESOLVED - Homepage now loads successfully! 🎉
  - **Root Cause**: Port configuration conflicts across multiple files
  - **The Fix**: 
    - Fixed `.env` file: `PORT=5005`, `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3005`
    - Used proper `npm run dev` script to start both servers concurrently
    - Aligned all port configurations (frontend 3005 ← proxy → backend 5005)
  - **Key Learning**: Environment files silently override npm script settings
  - **Result**: Homepage loads, images display correctly in Pinterest gallery
- [x] **Pagination/Search Functionality**: RESOLVED - Search and pagination now working! 🎉
  - **Issue**: Frontend React dev server was crashing, not the backend API
  - **Solution**: Restart frontend when it crashes (backend stays stable)
  - **Current State**: Full application functionality restored
    - ✅ Homepage loads with Pinterest-style gallery
    - ✅ Search functionality works
    - ✅ Pagination works (can navigate between pages)
    - ✅ Image detail modals work
  - **Note**: May be somewhat fragile - frontend occasionally needs restart
- [ ] **Frontend Stability**: Improve React dev server stability to prevent occasional crashes
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add better error boundaries and API error handling in frontend

### Successfully Resolved ✅
- [x] **Database Path Issues**: Moved databases back to root, updated all configuration files
- [x] **Server Connection Issues**: Fixed express-rate-limit trust proxy validation error
- [x] **Database Schema Enhancement**: Added width/height columns to all database files
- [x] **Complete Application Flow**: Fixed port configuration conflicts, homepage now loads
- [x] **Pagination/Search Functionality**: Full search and pagination working across all images

## Testing Results
- Successfully processed 150+ images with both Gemma and Claude models
- Claude 3.5 Haiku showing superior results in accuracy and consistency
- UI efficiently displays large image collections with fast navigation
- Database switching works seamlessly for model comparison
