## UI Requirements & User Workflows

### **Primary User Tasks**

1. **Discovery & Search**
   - Browse all processed images with thumbnails
   - Search by keywords in descriptions
   - Filter by multiple criteria simultaneously
   - Save and recall search queries

2. **Content Management**
   - View detailed metadata for each image
   - Edit/update AI-generated metadata fields
   - Bulk operations (tagging, categorizing)
   - Download original files or thumbnails

3. **Marketing Asset Selection**
   - Filter by marketing/social media scores
   - Find images by specific use cases
   - Identify high-quality images for campaigns
   - Export metadata for external tools

### **Key Search & Filter Scenarios**

**Marketing Team Use Cases:**
- "5-star marketing photos with produce but no people" (exceptional hero images - very rare)
- "High quality landscape shots from summer rated 4+" (best seasonal banners in collection)
- "3+ social media score with children and gardening" (good quality engagement content)

**Content Management:**
- "Education tag with 6-10 people" (workshop documentation)
- "Celebration photos with 10+ people rated 4+" (community showcase)
- "Indoor cooking activities from fall season"

**Quality Control:**
- "Images rated 1-2 for visual quality" (candidates for deletion)
- "Failed processing status" (need manual review)
- "Missing activity tags" (need additional categorization)

### **Essential UI Components**

#### **Search & Filter Interface**
- **Text Search**: Primary subject, descriptions
- **Quality Filters**: Visual quality slider (1-5)
- **People Filters**: Has people toggle + count selector
- **Setting Filter**: Indoor/outdoor toggle
- **Activity Tags**: Multi-select checkboxes (12 categories)
- **Seasonal Filter**: Season dropdown
- **Marketing Filters**: Social media score, marketing score, use case
- **Technical Filters**: File type, size, processing status

#### **Results Display**
- **Grid View**: Thumbnail gallery with key metadata overlay
- **List View**: Detailed metadata in table format
- **Detail View**: Full-size image with complete metadata panel

#### **Metadata Management**
- **Edit Mode**: Inline editing of all AI-generated fields
- **Bulk Edit**: Update multiple images simultaneously
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity (score ranges, enum values)
- **History**: Track changes to metadata over time
- **Notes Field Display**: Show contextual insights from filename/path analysis (e.g., "From 2024 spring workshop series", "Part of harvest celebration collection")

#### **Export & Download**
- **Individual Downloads**: Original files + thumbnails
- **Bulk Export**: Selected images with metadata
- **Metadata Export**: CSV/JSON for external tools
- **Google Drive Links**: Direct access to original files
  - View URL: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{drive_file_id}/view`
