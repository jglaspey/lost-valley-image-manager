			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Migration (v4)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database migration into discrete steps: creating the migration script structure, implementing idempotent column additions, creating the new metadata_versions table, orchestrating the migration logic, and adding comprehensive documentation. Each subtask should be independently testable and handle edge cases like existing columns or tables.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational database migration task with moderate complexity. It requires careful handling of schema changes, idempotency, and proper error handling. The 5 subtasks are well-structured and cover all aspects from setup to documentation. The complexity is moderate due to the need for idempotent operations and proper transaction handling."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Enrich Image Records with Google Drive Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Google Drive metadata enrichment into API field updates, data mapping logic, and error handling. Focus on updating the Drive API calls to request additional fields, implementing the business logic for mapping nested metadata objects, and handling cases where metadata is missing or malformed.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves API integration and data mapping with moderate complexity. The 5 subtasks appropriately separate API changes from data processing logic. The complexity is manageable as it builds on existing Google Drive integration, but requires careful handling of nested API responses and fallback logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "API: Add Endpoints for Metadata Version History",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the API endpoints development by separating the GET versions endpoint, POST revert endpoint structure, version data retrieval logic, database update operations, and transaction management. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the API functionality with proper error handling and data validation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard API development task with moderate complexity. The 5 subtasks properly separate concerns between different endpoints and their internal logic. The complexity is moderate due to the need for proper transaction handling and data consistency in the revert operation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement Snapshotting on Metadata Edit",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the snapshotting functionality into data retrieval, version calculation, snapshot creation, metadata updates, and transaction management. Focus on ensuring data consistency and proper error handling throughout the process, with particular attention to transaction boundaries and rollback scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to the need for transaction management and data consistency. The 5 subtasks appropriately handle the sequential nature of the operations. The complexity is elevated because of the critical need to maintain data integrity during the snapshot-update process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Update Project Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This documentation task is straightforward and doesn't require subtask expansion. Focus on updating the README.md with new CLI features, environment variables, removing outdated deployment instructions, and adding notes about metadata versioning.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity documentation task that involves updating existing documentation to reflect new features. It's primarily a writing and editing task that doesn't require complex technical implementation or multiple development phases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Concurrency, Timeouts, and Rate Limit Handling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the concurrency implementation by separating configuration updates, semaphore-based concurrency limiting, retry logic with exponential backoff, timeout implementation, and error handling integration. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of robust API interaction with proper testing and error scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task involving concurrent programming, error handling, and external API integration. The 5 subtasks appropriately separate different aspects of robust API handling. The complexity is high due to the need for proper concurrency control, retry logic, and comprehensive error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Together AI as a Vision Provider",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize the Together AI integration by separating configuration updates, client class structure, API implementation, error handling, and factory integration. Focus on following existing patterns while implementing the specific requirements for the Together AI API, including proper authentication and response parsing.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-to-high complexity as it involves integrating a new external service provider. The 5 subtasks properly separate configuration, implementation, and integration concerns. The complexity is elevated due to the need to follow existing patterns while adapting to a new API's specific requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Display Full Metadata and Version History",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the frontend enhancement by separating API data fetching, UI component updates for new metadata fields, version history rendering, revert functionality implementation, and user feedback handling. Focus on proper state management and user experience considerations.",
			"reasoning": "This is a moderate complexity frontend task involving new API integration and UI updates. The 5 subtasks appropriately separate data fetching from UI rendering and user interactions. The complexity is moderate due to the need for proper state management and API integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Inline Editing for Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the inline editing feature into state management for edit mode, form implementation with controlled inputs, API integration for saving changes, success handling and UI updates, and comprehensive error handling. Focus on user experience and data consistency throughout the editing process.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-to-high complexity due to the need for complex state management, form handling, and API integration. The 5 subtasks properly separate UI state, form logic, and API interactions. The complexity is elevated due to the need for proper form validation, error handling, and state synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
